abstract = {{DNA} sequence analysis is a multistage process that includes the preparation of {DNA}, its fragmentation and base analysis, and the interpretation of the resulting sequence information. New technological advances have led to the automation of certain steps in this process and have raised the possibility of large-scale {DNA} sequencing efforts in the near future [for example, 1 million base pairs (Mb) per year]. New sequencing methodologies, fully automated instrumentation, and improvements in sequencing-related computational resources may render genome-size sequencing projects (100 Mb or larger) feasible during the next 5 to 10 years.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) data are used for both clinical care and clinical research. {DNA} sequence variants identified using {NGS} are often returned to patients/participants as part of clinical or research protocols. The current standard of care is to validate {NGS} variants using Sanger sequencing, which is costly and time-consuming. {METHODS}: We performed a large-scale, systematic evaluation of Sanger-based validation of {NGS} variants using data from the {ClinSeq\textregistered} project. We first used {NGS} data from 19 genes in 5 participants, comparing them to high-throughput Sanger sequencing results on the same samples, and found no discrepancies among 234 {NGS} variants. We then compared {NGS} variants in 5 genes from 684 participants against data from Sanger sequencing. {RESULTS}: Of over 5800 {NGS}-derived variants, 19 were not validated by Sanger data. Using newly designed sequencing primers, Sanger sequencing confirmed 17 of the {NGS} variants, and the remaining 2 variants had low quality scores from exome sequencing. Overall, we measured a validation rate of 99.965\% for {NGS} variants using Sanger sequencing, which was higher than many existing medical tests that do not necessitate orthogonal validation. {CONCLUSIONS}: A single round of Sanger sequencing is more likely to incorrectly refute a true-positive variant from {NGS} than to correctly identify a false-positive variant from {NGS}. Validation of {NGS}-derived variants using Sanger sequencing has limited utility, and best practice standards should not include routine orthogonal Sanger validation of {NGS} variants. \copyright 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.}

We developed a protocol based on single-molecule, circular consensus sequencing ({CCS}) to generate highly-accurate (99.8\%) long reads averaging 13.5 kb and applied it to sequence the well-characterized human {HG002}/{NA24385}. We optimized existing tools to comprehensively detect variants, achieving precision and recall above 99.91\% for {SNVs}, 95.98\% for indels, and 95.99\% for structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the high-quality Genome in a Bottle benchmark. Nearly all (99.64\%) variants are phased into haplotypes, which further improves variant detection. De novo assembly produces a highly contiguous and accurate genome with contig N50 above 15 Mb and concordance of 99.998\%. {CCS} reads match short reads for small variant detection, while enabling structural variant detection and de novo assembly at similar contiguity and markedly higher concordance than noisy long reads.}

We detected the temporal order of their enzymatic incorporation into a growing {DNA} strand with zero-mode waveguide nanostructure arrays, which provide optical observation volume confinement and enable parallel, simultaneous detection of thousands of single-molecule sequencing reactions. Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the {dNTPs} allows continuous observation of {DNA} synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to {DNA} secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were generated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3\%, with no systematic error beyond fluorophore-dependent error rates.}

In this article, we present the comparative study of seven assemblers, namely, {ABy\SS}, Velvet, Edena, {SGA}, Ray, {\SSAKE}, and Perga, using prokaryotic and eukaryotic paired-end as well as single-end data sets from Illumina platform. Results: Results showed that in case of single-end data sets, Velvet and {ABy\SS} outperformed in all the seven assemblers with comparatively low assembling time and high genome fraction. Velvet consumed the least amount of memory than any other assembler. In case of paired-end data sets, Velvet consumed least amount of time and produced high genome fraction after {ABy\SS} and Ray. In terms of low memory usage, {SGA} and Edena outperformed in all the assemblers. Ray also showed good genome fraction; however, extremely high assembling time consumed by the Ray might make it prohibitively slow on larger data sets of single and paired-end data. Conclusions: Our comparison study will provide assistance to the scientists for selecting the suitable assembler according to their data sets and will also assist the developers to upgrade or develop a new assembler for de novo assembling.}

Compared with short reads, the assemblies obtained from long-read sequencing platforms have much higher contig continuity and genome completeness as long fragments are able to extend paths into problematic or repetitive regions. Many successful assembly applications of the Pacific Biosciences technology have been reported ranging from small bacterial genomes to large plant and animal genomes. Recently, genome assemblies using Oxford Nanopore {MinION} data have attracted much attention due to the portability and low cost of this novel sequencing instrument. In this paper, we re-sequenced a well characterized genome, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae {S288C} strain using three different platforms: {MinION}, {PacBio} and {MiSeq}. We present a comprehensive metric comparison of assemblies generated by various pipelines and discuss how the platform associated data characteristics affect the assembly quality. With a given read depth of {31X}, the assemblies from both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore {MinION} show excellent continuity and completeness for the 16 nuclear chromosomes, but not for the mitochondrial genome, whose reconstruction still represents a significant challenge.}

Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of {PacBio} and {ONT}, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of size-selected {PacBio}, non-size-selected {ONT} and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies ({PacBio}+Illumina and {ONT}+Illumina). Results: {PacBio} shows overall better data quality, while {ONT} provides a higher yield. As with data quality, {PacBio} performs marginally better than {ONT} in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both {PacBio} and {ONT} sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of {ONT} reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both {PacBio} and {ONT} can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.}

We aim to promote standards that will facilitate comparative approaches to invertebrate genomics and collaborations across the international scientific community. Candidate study taxa include species from Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, Placozoa, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, Annelida, Bryozoa, and Platyhelminthes, among others. {GIGA} will target 7000 noninsect/nonnematode species, with an emphasis on marine taxa because of the unrivaled phyletic diversity in the oceans. Priorities for selecting invertebrates for sequencing will include, but are not restricted to, their phylogenetic placement; relevance to organismal, ecological, and conservation research; and their importance to fisheries and human health. We highlight benefits of sequencing both whole genomes ({DNA}) and transcriptomes and also suggest policies for genomic-level data access and sharing based on transparency and inclusiveness.

abstract = {Genomics promises comprehensive surveying of genomes and metagenomes, but rapidly changing technologies and expanding data volumes make evaluation of completeness a challenging task. Technical sequencing quality metrics can be complemented by quantifying completeness of genomic datasets in terms of the expected gene content of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs ({BUSCO}, http://busco.ezlab.org). The latest software release implements a complete refactoring of the code to make it more flexible and extendable to facilitate high-throughput assessments. The original six lineage assessment datasets have been updated with improved species sampling, 34 new subsets have been built for vertebrates, arthropods, fungi, and prokaryotes that greatly enhance resolution, and datasets are now also available for nematodes, protists, and plants. Here we present {BUSCO} v3 with example analyses that highlight the wide-ranging utility of {BUSCO} assessments, which extend beyond quality control of genomics datasets to applications in comparative genomics analyses, gene predictor training, metagenomics, and phylogenomics. \copyright The Author(s) 2017.

abstract = {{SUMMARY}: Limitations of genome sequencing techniques have led to dozens of assembly algorithms, none of which is perfect. A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present {QUAST}-a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. {QUAST} can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. {QUAST} produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used {QUAST} to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. {QUAST} tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the {QUAST} website. {AVAILABILITY}: http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast . {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

abstract = {Genome sequencing projects have been initiated for a wide range of eukaryotes. A few projects have reached completion, but most exist as draft assemblies. As one of the main reasons to sequence a genome is to obtain its catalog of genes, an important question is how complete or completable the catalog is in unfinished genomes. To answer this question, we have identified a set of core eukaryotic genes ({CEGs}), that are extremely highly conserved and which we believe are present in low copy numbers in higher eukaryotes. From an analysis of a phylogenetically diverse set of eukaryotic genome assemblies, we found that the proportion of {CEGs} mapped in draft genomes provides a useful metric for describing the gene space, and complements the commonly used N50 length and x-fold coverage values.}

abstract = {Polyploidy or duplication of an entire genome occurs in the majority of angiosperms. The understanding of polyploid genomes is important for the improvement of those crops, which humans rely on for sustenance and basic nutrition. As climate change continues to pose a potential threat to agricultural production, there will increasingly be a demand for plant cultivars that can resist biotic and abiotic stresses and also provide needed and improved nutrition. In the past decade, Next Generation Sequencing ({NGS}) has fundamentally changed the genomics landscape by providing tools for the exploration of polyploid genomes. Here, we review the challenges of the assembly of polyploid plant genomes, and also present recent advances in genomic resources and functional tools in molecular genetics and breeding. As genomes of diploid and less heterozygous progenitor species are increasingly available, we discuss the lack of complexity of these currently available reference genomes as they relate to polyploid crops. Finally, we review recent approaches of haplotyping by phasing and the impact of third generation technologies on polyploid plant genome assembly.}

abstract = {Assembling a plant genome is challenging due to the abundance of repetitive sequences, yet no standard is available to evaluate the assembly of repeat space. {LTR} retrotransposons ({LTR}-{RTs}) are the predominant interspersed repeat that is poorly assembled in draft genomes. Here, we propose a reference-free genome metric called {LTR} Assembly Index ({LAI}) that evaluates assembly continuity using {LTR}-{RTs}. After correcting for {LTR}-{RT} amplification dynamics, we show that {LAI} is independent of genome size, genomic {LTR}-{RT} content, and gene space evaluation metrics (i.e., {BUSCO} and {CEGMA}). By comparing genomic sequences produced by various sequencing techniques, we reveal the significant gain of assembly continuity by using long-read-based techniques over short-read-based methods. Moreover, {LAI} can facilitate iterative assembly improvement with assembler selection and identify low-quality genomic regions. To apply {LAI}, intact {LTR}-{RTs} and total {LTR}-{RTs} should contribute at least 0.1\% and 5\% to the genome size, respectively. The {LAI} program is freely available on {GitHub}: https://github.com/oushujun/{LTR\_retriever}.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: With the rapid increase in genome sequencing projects for non-model organisms, numerous genome assemblies are currently in progress or available as drafts, but not made available as satisfactory, usable genomes. Data quality assessment of genome assemblies is gaining importance not only for people who perform the assembly/re-assembly processes, but also for those who attempt to use assemblies as maps in downstream analyses. Recent studies of the quality control, quality evaluation/ assessment of genome assemblies have focused on either quality control of reads before assemblies or evaluation of the assemblies with respect to their contiguity and correctness. However, correctness assessment depends on a reference and is not applicable for de novo assembly projects. Hence, development of methods providing both post-assembly and pre-assembly quality assessment reports for examining the quality/correctness of de novo assemblies and the input reads is worth studying. {RESULTS}: We present {SQUAT}, an efficient tool for both pre-assembly and post-assembly quality assessment of de novo genome assemblies. The pre-assembly module of {SQUAT} computes quality statistics of reads and presents the analysis in a well-designed interface to visualize the distribution of high- and poor-quality reads in a portable {HTML} report. The post-assembly module of {SQUAT} provides read mapping analytics in an {HTML} format. We categorized reads into several groups including uniquely mapped reads, multiply mapped, unmapped reads; for uniquely mapped reads, we further categorized them into perfectly matched, with substitutions, containing clips, and the others. We carefully defined the poorly mapped ({PM}) reads into several groups to prevent the underestimation of unmapped reads; indeed, a high PM would be a sign of a poor assembly that requires researchers' attention for further examination or improvements before using the assembly. Finally, we evaluate {SQUAT} with six datasets, including the genome assemblies for eel, worm, mushroom, and three bacteria. The results show that {SQUAT} reports provide useful information with details for assessing the quality of assemblies and reads. {AVAILABILITY}: The {SQUAT} software with links to both its docker image and the on-line manual is freely available at https://github.com/luke831215/{SQUAT} .}

We identified seven types of non-canonical {LTRs} from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of non-canonical {LTRs} are Copia elements, with which the {LTR} is four times shorter than that of other Copia elements, which may be a result of their target specificity.
