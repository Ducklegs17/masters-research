abstract = {{DNA} sequence analysis is a multistage process that includes the preparation of {DNA}, its fragmentation and base analysis, and the interpretation of the resulting sequence information. New technological advances have led to the automation of certain steps in this process and have raised the possibility of large-scale {DNA} sequencing efforts in the near future [for example, 1 million base pairs (Mb) per year]. New sequencing methodologies, fully automated instrumentation, and improvements in sequencing-related computational resources may render genome-size sequencing projects (100 Mb or larger) feasible during the next 5 to 10 years.}

Biol. 94, 441-448] but makes use of the 2',3'-dideoxy and arabinonucleoside analogues of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which act as specific chain-terminating inhibitors of {DNA} polymerase. The technique has been applied to the {DNA} of bacteriophage {varphiX174} and is more rapid and more accurate than either the plus or the minus method.}

abstract = {The four best known {DNA} sequencing techniques are reviewed. Important practical issues covered are read-length, speed, accuracy, throughput, cost, as well as the automation of sample handling and preparation. The methods reviewed are: (i) the Sanger method and its most important variants (enzymic methods); (ii) the Maxam \& Gilbert method and other chemical methods; (iii) the Pyrosequencing method--{DNA} sequencing in real time by the detection of released pyrophosphate ({PPi}); and (iv) single molecule sequencing with exonuclease (exonuclease digestion of a single molecule composed of a single strand of fluorescently labelled deoxynucleotides). Each method is briefly described, the current literature is covered, advantages, disadvantages, and the most suitable applications of each method are discussed.}

abstract = {Determining the order of nucleic acid residues in biological samples is an integral component of a wide variety of research applications. Over the last fifty years large numbers of researchers have applied themselves to the production of techniques and technologies to facilitate this feat, sequencing {DNA} and {RNA} molecules. This time-scale has witnessed tremendous changes, moving from sequencing short oligonucleotides to millions of bases, from struggling towards the deduction of the coding sequence of a single gene to rapid and widely available whole genome sequencing. This article traverses those years, iterating through the different generations of sequencing technology, highlighting some of the key discoveries, researchers, and sequences along the way.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) data are used for both clinical care and clinical research. {DNA} sequence variants identified using {NGS} are often returned to patients/participants as part of clinical or research protocols. The current standard of care is to validate {NGS} variants using Sanger sequencing, which is costly and time-consuming. {METHODS}: We performed a large-scale, systematic evaluation of Sanger-based validation of {NGS} variants using data from the {ClinSeq\textregistered} project. We first used {NGS} data from 19 genes in 5 participants, comparing them to high-throughput Sanger sequencing results on the same samples, and found no discrepancies among 234 {NGS} variants. We then compared {NGS} variants in 5 genes from 684 participants against data from Sanger sequencing. {RESULTS}: Of over 5800 {NGS}-derived variants, 19 were not validated by Sanger data. Using newly designed sequencing primers, Sanger sequencing confirmed 17 of the {NGS} variants, and the remaining 2 variants had low quality scores from exome sequencing. Overall, we measured a validation rate of 99.965\% for {NGS} variants using Sanger sequencing, which was higher than many existing medical tests that do not necessitate orthogonal validation. {CONCLUSIONS}: A single round of Sanger sequencing is more likely to incorrectly refute a true-positive variant from {NGS} than to correctly identify a false-positive variant from {NGS}. Validation of {NGS}-derived variants using Sanger sequencing has limited utility, and best practice standards should not include routine orthogonal Sanger validation of {NGS} variants. \copyright 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.}

abstract = {The major {DNA} sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly-accurate short reads or noisy long reads. We developed a protocol based on single-molecule, circular consensus sequencing ({CCS}) to generate highly-accurate (99.8\%) long reads averaging 13.5 kb and applied it to sequence the well-characterized human {HG002}/{NA24385}. We optimized existing tools to comprehensively detect variants, achieving precision and recall above 99.91\% for {SNVs}, 95.98\% for indels, and 95.99\% for structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the high-quality Genome in a Bottle benchmark. Nearly all (99.64\%) variants are phased into haplotypes, which further improves variant detection. De novo assembly produces a highly contiguous and accurate genome with contig N50 above 15 Mb and concordance of 99.998\%. {CCS} reads match short reads for small variant detection, while enabling structural variant detection and de novo assembly at similar contiguity and markedly higher concordance than noisy long reads.}
