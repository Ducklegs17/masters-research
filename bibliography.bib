abstract = {A new method for determining nucleotide sequences in {DNA} is described. It is similar to the "plus and minus" method [Sanger, F. \& Coulson, A. R. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 94, 441-448] but makes use of the 2',3'-dideoxy and arabinonucleoside analogues of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which act as specific chain-terminating inhibitors of {DNA} polymerase. The technique has been applied to the {DNA} of bacteriophage {varphiX174} and is more rapid and more accurate than either the plus or the minus method.}

abstract = {Determining the order of nucleic acid residues in biological samples is an integral component of a wide variety of research applications. Over the last fifty years large numbers of researchers have applied themselves to the production of techniques and technologies to facilitate this feat, sequencing {DNA} and {RNA} molecules. This time-scale has witnessed tremendous changes, moving from sequencing short oligonucleotides to millions of bases, from struggling towards the deduction of the coding sequence of a single gene to rapid and widely available whole genome sequencing. This article traverses those years, iterating through the different generations of sequencing technology, highlighting some of the key discoveries, researchers, and sequences along the way.
