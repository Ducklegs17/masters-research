## Project Goals

#### 1) 

Written resource that gives information regarding: 

* current costs of sequencing
* amount of bases output/number of reads
* error profile, pros and cons of each type of sequencing
* tool benchmarking for speed, cpu hours etc.
* genome quality that might be expected
* Detailed examples.

#### 2) 

A number of reproducible pipelines that align with the suggested things above. 

#### 3)

A pipeline for assessing quality of a de-novo assembly 
 
#### 4)

 A reproducible pipeline for benchmarking tools and new techniques.
